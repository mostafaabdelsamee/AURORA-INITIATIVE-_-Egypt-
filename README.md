# Aurora Initiative – Reimagining AI Governance  
*A comprehensive framework for digital sovereignty and ethical AI oversight*

The Aurora Initiative is a multi-phase research project developing an innovative AI governance framework. AI governance involves processes, standards and guardrails that help ensure AI systems remain safe and ethical. As AI systems grow more integral to society, governments worldwide are pursuing “digital sovereignty” – ensuring sovereign control over AI infrastructures. The Aurora Initiative embeds these principles by proposing a layered Anti-AI supervisory system that actively monitors and limits other AIs, thereby preserving human oversight and national interests.
